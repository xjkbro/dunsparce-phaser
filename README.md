## **About the Game**

This is a game I built for Mintbean's August 2021 Hiring Hackathon Event. I primarily used PhaserJS, React, Bootstrap to build the entire landing page and game. This was my first attempt at creating a game and I am pretty proud of what I had accomplished in the short time I had to do this. This game is essentially a FlappyBird remake and remodel. The assets we're model and created based off the orignal game assets and was done by me. The audio assets were found online that I believe were from the original game as well.
